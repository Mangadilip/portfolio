        <p>➢ Ship Detection in High Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Images</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ship detection is a crucial but challenging task in optical remote
            sensing images. Recently, thanks to the emergence of deep neural
            networks (DNNs), significant progress has been made in ship
            detection. However, there are still two significant issues that must
            be addressed the high-resolution optical images may confuse the
            background with the ship, leading to more false alarms during
            detection and the detector receives few positive samples due to the
            sparse and uneven distribution of ships in the optical remote
            sensing images.

          ➢ Information Exchange Framework to Enhance cloud Storage safety in
          the Period of Massive Data
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cloud computing is a new computing model, in which all resource on
            Internet from a cloud resource pool and can be allocated to
            different applications and services dynamically. In contrast to
            traditional solutions, cloud provider stores the shared data in the
            large data centre outside the trust domain of the data owner, which
            may trigger the problem of data confidentiality. This paper proposes
            a secret sharing group key management protocol (SSGK) to protect the
            communication process and shared data from unauthorized access.
